# Execution Instances for Montage Workflow

## Workflow Description

[Montage](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu) is a toolkit for assembling Flexible
Image Transport System (FITS) images into custom mosaics. The test case
implemented as a
[Pegasus workflow](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/montage-workflow-v2) aim to
re-project, background correct and add astronomical images into custom mosaics.
This test case is composed of eight different tasks:

  1. `mProject` - reprojects a single image to the scale defined in an
     alternate FITS header template.
  2. `mDiffFit` - Run mDiff immediatly followed by mFitplane and check the
     first to decide whether to run the second.
  3. `mConcatFit` - Merge multiple plane fit parameter files (from mFitplane)
     into one file.
  4. `mBgModel` - A modelling/fitting program.
  5. `mBackground` - Subtracts a planar background from a FITS image.
  6. `mImgtbl` -  Extracts the FITS header geometry information from a set of
     files and creates an ASCII image metadata table which is used by several
     of the other programs.
  7. `mAdd` - Coadd the reprojected images in an input list to form an output
     mosaic with FITS header keywords specified in a header file.
  8. `mViewer` - Command line application or visualizing FITS images, overlaying
     content (grids, symbols, etc.) on them and creating PNG or JPEG files.

### Research Publication

Details of the Montage workflow description, computational jobs, and
performance metrics can be found in the following research publication:

  using Montage, Pegasus and Amazon Web Services," in 23rd Annual Astronomical
  Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS) Conference, 2013.

## Execution Instances

Execution instannces are formatted according to the
[WfCommons JSON format](https://github.com/wfcommons/workflow-schema) for
describing workflow executions. Execution instances from different computing
platforms are organized into sub-folders.

Instance files are named using the following convention:
`montage-<COMPUTE_PLATFORM>-<SURVEY>-<DEGREE>-<RUN_ID>.json`, where:

- `<COMPUTE_PLATFORM>`: The compute platform where the actual Pegasus workflow
  was executed (e.g., `chameleon`).
- `<SURVEY>`: The data set and band to use for the mosaic (**2mass**:
  Two-Micron All-Sky Survey; **dss**: STScI Digitized Sky Survey).
- `<DEGREE>`: The size (in degrees) to be used for the width/height of the
  final mosaic.
- `<RUN_ID>`: The workflow execution identification.

### Workflow Structure

The Montage workflow structure depends on the _data set and band_
(`<SURVEY>`) used for the mosaic and the _size (in degrees)_ (`<DEGREE>`) to
be used for the width/height of the final mosaic. In this implementation,
the workflow has **3 bands** (red, blue, and green), where each band defines
"**a branch**" of the workflow. For each branch:

- The degree defines the number of tasks in a branch. The number of `mProject`
  and `mBackground` tasks are the same.
- An `mDiffFit` task is generated to from pairs of `mProjectPP` tasks. The
  number of `mDiffFit` tasks depends on the number of overlapped tiles.
- Each branch has only one instance of `mConcatFit`, `mBgModel`, `mImgtbl`,
  `mAdd`, and `mViewer` tasks, regardless the workflow degree.

An additional `mViewer` task at the bottom of the workflow combines all 3 bands
to create a colored JPEG.

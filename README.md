# Pegasus Workflow Execution Traces

This repository contains workflow execution traces generated from
[Pegasus](http://pegasus.isi.edu) workflow executions. The traces
hosted in this repository use the
[WorkflowHub JSON format](https://github.com/workflowhub/workflow-schema)
for describing workflow executions.

#### Repository Structure

Workflow execution traces are organized into sub-folders within this
repository. Each sub-folder represents a _workflow application_, which
itself contains sub-folders for workflow executions in different
_computing platforms_.

#### Workflow Simulator

The execution traces provided in this repository are compatible to any
[simulator framework](https://workflowhub.org/simulator.html) that implements
the [WorkflowHub JSON format](https://github.com/workflowhub/workflow-schema).
Specifically, the workflow execution traces hosted here were generated using
the `wrench-pegasus-parser.py` tool that is distributed as part of the
[WRENCH-Pegasus](https://github.com/wrench-project/pegasus) simulator.
